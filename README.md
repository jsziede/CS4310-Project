# CS4310-Project

A single page web app that allows a user to create randomly generated graphs. These graphs are colored so that any two connected nodes do not have the same color, while attempting to use the least amount of colors as possible. The user is able to see stats about the graph, including number of colors used and the time taken to color it.
